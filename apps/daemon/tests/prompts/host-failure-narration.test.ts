/**
 * W84 — a CLASS guard for "host infrastructure narrated into the visible reply".
 *
 * This defect has now been fixed three times, each time as a one-off:
 *
 *   1. OPEND-2577  「图片生成服务暂时不可用」   (media)   → media-failure-user-copy.test.ts
 *   2. W81         「桌面渲染服务暂不可用」     (render)  → render-check-user-copy.test.ts
 *   3. W84         research / x-research / video-shortform / last30days
 *
 * The first two guards assert exact historical sentences. A fourth instance in
 * a fourth subsystem sails past both, because neither knows what the CLASS is.
 * That is what this file adds: a scanner over every prompt-bearing source we
 * ship, plus a frozen registry. A new line that pairs a failure condition with
 * an instruction to tell the user goes RED here on the commit that writes it,
 * instead of arriving later as a user screenshot.
 *
 * ── The product rule (not invented here) ──────────────────────────────────
 * OPEND-2577 settled it: operational detail belongs in tool output and daemon
 * logs, and must never be copied into the user-visible assistant reply.
 * The canonical correct phrasing already lives in media-contract.ts:
 *
 *   "If the command fails, retain the command's actual stderr / exit status in
 *    the tool trace and daemon logs. Do not invent a root cause or copy
 *    diagnostic text into the visible assistant reply."
 *
 * ── The distinction this file MUST hold ───────────────────────────────────
 * A keyword ban would be useless: it would flag the remediation sentences too
 * (they necessarily say "daemon logs" and "stderr"), and it would flag the
 * model reporting its own work. So the scanner does not decide — it only
 * FINDS. Every hit must carry a written verdict in REGISTRY below:
 *
 *   'suppression-rule'  the line FORBIDS narration. This is the fix, not the bug.
 *   'user-requested'    the user explicitly asked for the thing that failed, so
 *                       they are owed a next step (the OPEND-2577 carve-out).
 *   'self-report'       the model reporting on its OWN work, not on host state.
 *   'unrelated'         keyword coincidence; nothing to do with host failure.
 *   'pending-ruling'    genuinely contested — needs a product decision, and is
 *                       parked here in the open rather than silently fixed.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO verdict that means "host failure, narrated, and
 * that's fine". Waving a real leak through requires mislabelling it in a diff
 * a reviewer can see.

//     in your reply". Note it names no infrastructure at all, which is exactly
//     why an infra-noun detector missed it (verified in the vacuum test below).
//
//   Arm B (canned copy): localized user-facing copy that names host state.
//     This is what OPEND-2577 looked like — 「图片生成服务暂时不可用」 is a
//     sentence to SAY, not an instruction, so Arm A cannot see it.
