// `time_to_first_visible_output_ms` is supposed to answer "once the model
// started producing, how long until the user could actually SEE something?".
// It was published for months as a copy of `time_to_first_token_ms`, because
// `noteFirstTokenAt()` stamped BOTH `first_token` and `first_visible_output`
// from the same call with the same timestamp — so the difference was 0 for
// every run ever recorded (205,795 `run_finished` events over 7 days, p50 =
// p90 = p99 = max = 0).
//
// The daemon does NOT emit every token it decodes. Between "this is a token"
// and "these bytes left the daemon" sit filters that can withhold output: the
// `<od-title>` marker stripper, the fabricated-role-marker safety guard
// (#3247), and — when the OD Next strategy is running the turn — the machine
// protocol, which withholds any text that might still turn out to be a
// reserved `<open-design-…>` block.
//
// These tests drive the REAL wiring (`startServer` + a fake opencode CLI) and
// read the two fields off the real PostHog `run_finished` payload, because the
// bug was never in a helper — it was in which call site owns the mark.
//
// Every case names the OD Next rollout mode it runs under. Neither the
// strategy-off nor the strategy-active coverage may rest on whatever
// `OD_NEXT_STRATEGY_ROLLOUT` happens to default to: that default has already
// been `active`, is expected to flip to disabled after 0.21.0, and is a
// user-facing switch besides. A suite that inherited it would silently stop
// covering the path it was written for the day the default moved.
