// Card covers: freeze what the card will show at the chokepoint (spec §4.1 +
// §6.3).
//
// TWO COVER PATHS LIVE HERE, and they differ only in what "freeze" can mean:
//
//   * HTML gets its RENDERER INPUT frozen now and rendered later, because a
//     self-contained document is portable evidence — see the four steps below.
//   * VIDEO gets its FIRST FRAME decoded now, inside a verified window, because
//     there is no portable freeze for a video short of copying it, and the
//     capacity ruling forbids that. The mechanics live in `video-cover.ts`;
//     this file owns the per-ref bookkeeping both paths share.
//
// WHY A FREEZE AND NOT A JOB. The obvious implementation — "queue a screenshot
// of this file, take it when the renderer is free" — is a version race, not an
// optimization. Between the queue and the render the agent's next turn can
// overwrite the file, and the cover then shows a version that message never
// produced. Worse, it does so silently: a screenshot of the wrong bytes looks
// exactly like a screenshot of the right ones.
//
// So the input is frozen while the daemon still owns the moment, and the freeze
// is STRUCTURAL rather than advisory:
//
//   1. The entry HTML and every local dependency it references are read inside
//      one window, and every file read is fingerprinted (size + mtime).
//   2. The whole graph is inlined into ONE self-contained document. The result
//      carries no relative URL that could resolve to a project file.
//   3. The window is re-verified at the end. Any drift — a write that landed
//      while we were reading — voids the freeze instead of producing a document
//      torn across two versions.
//   4. The renderer is handed that document with NO `baseHref`. It loads from a
//      `data:` URL, so even a render that starts minutes later has no address
//      for the live workspace. It cannot read latest; there is nothing to read.
//
// Step 4 is what makes the async render safe. Steps 1-3 are what make step 4
// honest — a self-contained document assembled from a moving target would still
// be a lie, just an unfalsifiable one.
//
// WHY FAILURE IS SILENT. Product ruling 2026-09-02: a cover that cannot be
// rendered falls back to the card's live preview, with no placeholder and no
// error copy ("不允许退回不就一个错误文案显示在上面了?这感觉更奇怪呢"). That is
// coherent with the click ruling of the same day — clicking a card always opens
// the workspace's LATEST file, for HTML and images alike — so a card that falls
// back to live is showing the same thing the click would open. There is no
// "cover says one thing, click shows another" state to explain away.
