/**
 * B11 「引导对话」 — steer a turn that is still running.
 *
 * The chat queue's third action is NOT "cancel and resend". Steering writes one
 * more JSONL `user` frame onto the agent child's stdin while the turn is still
 * executing, so the model reads the new instruction without losing the work it
 * has already done.
 *
 * That only means anything when three things hold at once, and each of them
 * fails silently if we guess:
 *
 *  1. The runtime delivers its prompt as `stream-json`. That is the only writer
 *     that leaves stdin open past the opening prompt — every other plain-text
 *     runtime gets its whole prompt as a file-backed stdin at spawn
 *     (`spawnAgentProcess`), so there is no pipe left to write to.
 *     This is a permanent property of the agent, so callers should stop
 *     advertising the affordance rather than retry.
 *  2. The run is still live.
 *  3. `run.stdinOpen` is still true. A clean turn terminal closes stdin (see
 *     `applyClaudeStreamJsonRunBookkeeping`); a `stop_reason: 'tool_use'` pause
 *     deliberately does NOT — the model is parked mid-tool and still reading,
 *     which is exactly when steering is worth the most.
 *
 *     "Turn terminal" is either a `turn_end` or a `usage` event, and which one
 *     arrives first depends on the installed Claude Code build. On 2.1.259 the
 *     `assistant` wrapper's `stop_reason` is always null, so `turn_end` comes
 *     from `stream_event`/`message_delta` and exists only when
 *     `--include-partial-messages` was negotiated; without that flag the first
 *     terminal of the turn is the `usage` event synthesized from the `result`
 *     frame. `chat-run-lifecycle.ts` treats the two as equals for exactly this
 *     reason — see `claude-stream.ts`'s `emitTurnEndOnce` for the full
 *     three-source contract and the recordings that pin it down.
 *
 *     Practical consequence for callers: the steering window closes at the
 *     turn's `result` frame on every build, so the affordance is only live
 *     while the model is still working.
 *
 * `classifyRunSteering` is the single place that verdict is made; the HTTP
 * route, the CLI, and any future caller must go through it instead of
 * re-deriving the rule.
