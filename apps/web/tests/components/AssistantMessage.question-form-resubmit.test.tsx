/**
 * One question form occurrence answers exactly once.
 *
 * The inline `<question-form>` submit lock used to live only in a ref owned by
 * the mounted `FormBlock`. Leaving the project (or any remount: a refresh, a
 * conversation switch, a virtualized row recycling) rebuilt that ref as
 * "never submitted", so the same occurrence could be answered a second time
 * while the first answer was still being persisted or was still draining from
 * the busy-conversation queue. That produced two identical user answers and
 * two assistant runs for one logical task — duplicate model calls, duplicate
 * billing, and a split reply with a mid-turn action bar.
 *
 * The lock is therefore keyed on the form occurrence
 * (project + conversation + assistant message + form id) and survives the
 * remount; only an explicit submit failure re-opens it.
