 * project's persisted binding already names that same workspace. That binding
 * lives on the project read model and survives ProjectView's authorization-key
 * remount; unlike hook-local "first read" state it therefore cannot turn an
 * A-bound project into workspace B during a switch.
 *
 * A transient `unavailable` answer is not an authorization decision. When the
 * persisted project binding and exact caller still agree, keep asserting that
 * pair and let the daemon's mutation gate perform the fresh authoritative
 * membership check. Dropping the headers here would turn every project read
 * and run into `WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_REQUIRED` during a directory outage. A
 * `forbidden` answer remains authoritative and never borrows the caller.
 *
 * While the first scope read is pending, a caller whose workspace matches the
 * project's persisted workspace id may be used so the first request does not
 * escape unscoped.
 *
 * A project whose read model is explicitly unbound has one narrower exception:
 * an active Personal caller may witness the daemon's one-time transactional
 * adoption. This does not let the web authorize or persist the binding; the
 * daemon freshly verifies that exact Personal workspace/member pair and owns
 * the decision. Team callers, absent callers, and any failed/forbidden/
 * unavailable scope read stay headerless so the client cannot adopt the
