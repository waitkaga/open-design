// Chat panel runtime-health monitor.
//
// The chat panel is the one surface a user keeps open for hours while it
// accumulates unbounded state: messages, tool records, collapsed
// <details> blocks, artifact cards, an SSE stream writing into all of it.
// Every reliability problem we have shipped there — a 63k-event
// conversation taking 10.75s to open, a 2,799-node message list before
// lazy mounting, a renderer dying with `Reached heap limit` — was found
// by hand, after a user complained. This module turns those four failure
// modes into four numbers.
//
// What it answers, one event per question:
//
//   client_chat_first_paint      "How long until the user can read it?"
//   client_chat_dom_growth       "Is the DOM/heap growing without bound?"
//   client_chat_memory_pressure  "Who is about to OOM?"
//   client_chat_stream_health    "How janky is the UI while a run streams?"
//
// Transport is `reportSafetyEvent` — the consent-bypassing direct-fetch
// path that already carries `client_long_task`, `client_white_screen` and
// `client_boot_timing`. Stability ground truth must not disappear when a
// user opts out of product analytics; the reasoning is documented at the
// top of `analytics/error-tracking.ts`.
//
// Cost discipline. Measurement must never become the jank it measures:
//
//   - DOM/heap sampling runs on a 60s interval, inside
//     `requestIdleCallback`, and is skipped entirely while the tab is
//     hidden (a throttled background tab's numbers are not
//     representative and its beacons are pure noise).
//   - Node counting uses live `getElementsByTagName` collections, whose
//     `.length` is a native count, not an allocated NodeList.
//   - Jank is derived from the browser's own Long Tasks entries. We do
//     NOT sample `requestAnimationFrame`: `long-task.ts` already argues
//     rAF FPS counting is both a worse signal and a measurable cost, and
//     that decision stands here.
//   - A run window that saw zero long tasks emits nothing. Clean runs are
//     the common case; a zero-valued event per run would make this the
//     highest-volume event in the product while carrying no information.
//
// Privacy. Every field is structural — a count, a duration, a byte
// length, or a fixed enum. No message text, no file path, no prompt, no
// user-authored string is read, let alone transmitted.
