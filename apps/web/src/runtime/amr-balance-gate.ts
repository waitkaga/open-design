// Pre-run balance gate for the OpenDesign Cloud agent. There is exactly ONE
// balance that changes anything: $0.
//
//   HARD  — the run cannot possibly succeed: the account is signed out, or the
//           wallet balance is definitively <= $0. The send is blocked and the
//           subscription dialog is the only way forward (plus dismiss), and the
//           project page also lights the in-conversation upgrade card.
//   EMPTY_NOT_BLOCKED — the wallet is definitively <= $0 but the hard block
//           stood down (see `hardBlockMustStandDown`). The run starts and Vela
//           decides at admission; the $0 card still shows, because the wallet
//           really is empty.
//
// **There is no low-balance tier.** A positive balance — $1.20 included — is an
// `allow` and produces nothing: no card, no dialog, no delay. Product ruled the
// soft tier away on 2026-09-07 looking at its own screenshot: 「这个要不先不要
// 了,跟产品说了一下,不要这个了」, and scoped it on the follow-up: 「余额为零
// 的那个卡片要显示的,并且也要弹窗的」. Recorded as T66 in
// `specs/current/chat-panel-decisions-sheet.md`, which overturns the low-balance
// halves of T51 / T52 / T53.
//
// ⚠️ Do NOT bring the tier back by lowering a threshold constant to 0 — that
// leaves the concept alive in a shape nobody can see. There is no warning line
// here on purpose; `AMR_LOW_BALANCE_WARN_USD` was deleted, not zeroed.
//
// ⚠️ This is about the SEND GATE only. The card a run that DIED on money leaves
// behind is a different producer (`amrInsufficientBalanceFailure` in
// `ProjectView`) and is deliberately kept — T61 calls it 「那一轮为什么停下来的
// 凭据」, and its archived reading may well be positive.
//
// Legacy account-scoped reads fail open when unavailable. Every explicitly
// workspace-scoped run fails closed when its exact member epoch cannot be proven:
// falling back to the account wallet would make the preflight disagree with
// the final daemon spawn authority.
