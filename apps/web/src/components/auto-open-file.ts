//      preserves the golden path for short filePath inputs while still
//      rejecting external edits that happen to share a basename with a

 *     collapse the preview to nothing — that is the fallback the product owner
 *     ruled on explicitly, and it is also every conversation recorded before
 *     this marker existed.
 *
 *  2. **The user wins.** If the user has opened a file themselves during this
 *     turn, the agent does not get to yank it away. The asymmetry is the whole
 *     argument: being wrong in this direction costs one click (the file is
 *     still a chip away in the produced-files panel), while being wrong in the
 *     other direction throws away someone's place in a document they were
 *     mid-read on, with no undo and no explanation. Auto-open features earn
 *     their "focus theft" reputation precisely here.
 *
 *  3. **Created this turn.** A path that existed before the turn started is
 *     declined even when the agent names it. The agent is allowed to say which
 *     of ITS OWN outputs matters, not to navigate the workspace at will.
 *
 *  4. **Resolvable and previewable.** The name must exist in the file list and
 *     must not be a module of a multi-file HTML entry.
 *
 * Everything the daemon already proved — path is inside the project root, file
 * is non-empty — is deliberately NOT re-checked here. Re-deriving a security
 * property on the client would be the wrong side of the trust boundary and
 * would invite the two copies to disagree.

 * 「就让 agent 生成完,把那些产物在右侧全打开呗」, clarified the same day as
 * 「是全部的**主要**产物,记得」. A batch that generated four images opened four
 * artifact cards in the chat and two tabs on the right; the turn's deliverables
 * should all be on screen.
 *
 * This overturns exactly one of `selectAutoOpenProducedArtifact`'s three jobs.
 * Its `autoOpenPreviewRank` does:
 *
 *   1. **Is this an artifact at all?** rank 0 (decks, raw text, `.txt`,
 *      `sketch-*`, user sketches) never opens. UNCHANGED — the ruling is about
 *      the count, not the criterion, so scripts, configs and intermediate
 *      outputs stay out exactly as before.
 *   2. **Which KIND is this turn's deliverable?** HTML outranks markdown
 *      outranks media, because "image, video and audio are the fallback for
 *      media-ONLY turns" — a page's screenshots are incidental to the page.
 *      UNCHANGED, and it is what keeps "all the primary artifacts" from
 *      quietly becoming "every previewable file the turn wrote".
 *   3. **Which ONE of the equally-ranked winners?** newest mtime. OVERTURNED:
 *      that tie-break was arbitrary, and picking one of four sibling images is
 *      precisely the bug. All of them open; the tie-break now only decides
 *      which is focused.
 *
 * The `preferSiteEntry` carve-out survives for the same reason rank 2 does: a
 * website clone's deliverable is the SITE, and its entry is the door. Opening
 * every produced page would be one tab per route.
 *
 * No cap is applied here. A turn that legitimately produces N primary artifacts
 * opens N tabs (see OPEND-2571, where a 16-image turn is already reported as
 * flooding the conversation) — capping that is a product decision, not one to
 * take in a selection helper.
