/**
 * Web/daemon `<question-form>` parse parity (OPEND-2364).
 *
 * The clarification form has two independent parsers by design: the web
 * renderer (`apps/web/src/artifacts/question-form.ts`, `splitOnQuestionForms`)
 * decides what the user sees, and the daemon detector
 * (`apps/daemon/src/question-form-detect.ts`, `scanQuestionForms`) decides what
 * the host believes was asked. The root `AGENTS.md` boundary forbids
 * `apps/daemon` importing `apps/web/src`, so the daemon side is a deliberate
 * mirror — and its own header says to keep it in sync or promote a shared
 * parser once the two drift.
 *
 * They did drift, and the two answers are load-bearing against each other. The
 * OD Next coordinator blocks a `clarification_required` turn that rendered no
 * form (`od_next_clarification_form_missing`), settling the strategy task
 * terminal + blocked. When the web renders a form the daemon scored as absent,
 * the user is left filling in a live form belonging to an already-terminal
 * task, and submitting it returns 409 STRATEGY_TASK_STATE_MISMATCH. That is the
 * production report: an agent wrapped its form in a duplicate of its own open
 * tag, the web unwound to the inner form and rendered it, the daemon charged
 * the outer block as unrenderable and blocked the task.
 *
 * Each parser's own suite passed throughout, because neither owned the shared
 * corpus. This test does. It lives in `e2e/tests/` per the root `AGENTS.md`
 * rule that cross-app consistency checks belong here — it is the only layer
 * allowed to observe both parsers at once.
 *
 * Adding a markup shape: put it in `CORPUS` with a name that says what the
 * agent did wrong, not what the parsers should return. The expected value is
 * always "whatever the web renderer does", because the web renderer is what
 * the user sees.
 *
 * The web parser is loaded through a computed specifier, and that is load-
 * bearing rather than stylistic. A static import would pull `apps/web` source
 * into this package's TypeScript program, where it is compiled under settings
 * it was never written for — e2e resolves modules as `nodenext` with
 * `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `apps/web` as `bundler` without it — so
 * `pnpm typecheck` fails on the web file's own extensionless imports and
 * optional properties. Those are not defects; they are the reason the root
 * `AGENTS.md` tells an app not to borrow another app's private source, and
 * tells this layer to promote shared logic into a pure package instead.
 * Promoting the parser is the right end state and is deliberately not done
 * here: it would mean restructuring the renderer that currently defines
 * correct behavior, in the same change that fixes a production block. Until
 * then this keeps the two honest without compiling either one against the
 * other's settings; the runtime shape is asserted on load, so a rename in
 * `apps/web` fails this test loudly instead of silently skipping it.
