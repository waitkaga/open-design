 * What to do next about a media generation that failed.
 *
 * This is the ONLY failure vocabulary a client — the agent that dispatched
 * the render, the chat host, a CLI caller — is meant to branch on. The
 * internal `code` stays for triage; it is not an answer to "so what now?",
 * and the moment it reached a user's screen it stopped being one at all
 * (「原因未分类(错误代码:MEDIA_DISPATCH_FAILED)」 is a support ticket, not a
 * next step).
 *
 * The values are the run-error ladder (`docs/design/run-errors/error-ux-design.md`
 * §3, mirrored in `apps/web/src/runtime/amr-guidance.ts`) applied to media, so
 * media failures do not grow a second, differently-shaped taxonomy:
 *
 * - rung 1 · the user can fix it right here — `revise-request`,
 *   `switch-model`, `open-settings`, `sign-in`
 * - rung 2 · nothing to fix, it may just work next time — `retry-later`
 * - rung 3 · this path cannot work; take a different one — `add-credit`,
 *   `update-app`, `unsupported`
 * - rung 4 · retrying is futile and we have no other lever — `contact-support`
 *
 * Two failures that put the user in the same place get the SAME value on
 * purpose: a missing OpenAI key and a model with no configured renderer are
 * different bugs and one sentence ("fill it in under Settings").
