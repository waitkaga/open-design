   *    block, which is the same boundary at which the UI's "thinking" row is
   *    replaced. A decrease means "new block", not "lost progress".
   *
   * It is an **estimate**, not the bill. The settled figure

   * This is the CONCLUSION drawn from `tool_input_delta`, not a relay of it. The

   * note on `tool_input_delta` above for why its payload must stay unrendered.
   *
   * Guarantees a client may rely on:
   *  - **At most once per `id`.** The scanner is retired when it answers.
   *  - **Complete or absent.** A path is emitted only after its closing quote,
   *    so a truncated stream yields nothing rather than half a name. Non-file
   *    tools (`Bash`, `Grep`, …) are never scanned at all.
   *  - **Stable.** `path` equals the `file_path` of the `tool_use` that follows
   *    for the same `id`, so a row built from this never renames itself.
   *  - **`startedAt` is when the daemon first saw this call** — the
   *    `content_block_start` of its `tool_use` block, NOT the moment the path
   *    finished scanning (measured 0.2s apart on a real 2.1.260 run) and NOT
   *    the moment the arguments closed (94.1s later on that same run). It is
   *    the same immovable origin `tool_input_progress` reports for this `id`,
   *    so the two events never disagree and the row's seconds never jump back.
   *
   * Why the origin has to ride on THIS event and not only on
   * `tool_input_progress`: `Edit` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit` / `replace`
   * emit no progress at all (their `−M` is unknowable mid-stream), so this is
   * the only thing those calls ever send early. Without it their row shows a
   * file name and a dead stopwatch, and — because
   * `dropSupersededInFlightToolUses` carries this origin onto the settled row —
   * the finished row falls back to the emit-time stamp and reports only the
   * disk write, hiding the whole argument stream behind a "0.1s".
   *

   * This is the same conclusion drawn repeatedly: the daemon counts newlines in

   *    `apps/web/src/runtime/chat/format.ts` `diffStat` computes from the
   *    settled `tool_use`. The last one sent before `tool_use` arrives EQUALS
   *    that `+N`, so the number never jumps at the hand-off.
   *  - **Whole-file writes only.** `Write` / `write_file`. `Edit` and friends
   *    settle as `+N −M`, and `−M` cannot be known until `old_string` is
   *    complete — so no half of it is sent rather than passing 0 off as truth.
   *  - **Throttled, and self-describing.** At most one per argument fragment,

   *    fraction of `tool_input_delta`'s rate. It repeats `path`, so a client

   *    the LATEST one per `id`, never the first.
   *  - **It upgrades.** ACP infers the tool name from `kind`/`title` and the
   *    path from `locations`/`rawInput`/title, so a later frame can replace a
   *    weaker guess — including replacing "no arguments at all", which is what
   *    every real first frame carries.
   *  - **`input` is a whole argument object**, not a single path, because the
   *    interesting early fact for the dominant case (bash, 58% of the hidden
