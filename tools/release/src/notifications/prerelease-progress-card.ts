// Watches one prerelease across three workflow runs and keeps a single Feishu
// card up to date.
//
// The single-writer rule is the whole design. A PATCH replaces the entire card,
// so if the three build jobs each tried to update "their" row they would each
// overwrite the other two — every one of them only knows its own state. Nothing
// in the build path talks to Feishu at all: this job owns the message, and it
// learns everything by polling the GitHub jobs API of
//   * the release-prerelease run that is building and publishing,
//   * the release-prerelease-tests run dispatched alongside it,
//   * the release-prerelease-smoke run dispatched after publish.
//
// It starts immediately and depends on nothing, so it costs the release
// pipeline nothing; it lives in a workflow of its own so it cannot hold the
// pipeline's repository-wide concurrency group.
//
// The card is posted on the first poll, before any package exists, and every
// later state is an edit of that same message. The fear that used to withhold
// it — a "构建中…" card left standing forever when a build dies — is answered by
// the machinery that grew around it since: a failed lane renders its own
// terminal state, a release where nothing shipped turns the card red, and the
// watcher's own timeout stamps the card instead of abandoning it. Silence
// during the entire build window bought nothing and cost the channel the one
// thing it wanted, which is knowing a release is under way.
